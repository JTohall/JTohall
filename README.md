- A profile readme, that says something about who you are and what repositories you want to showcase.  (see Managing your profile README - GitHub Docs)
- These (showcase) repositories should each have their own readme file indicating (where relevant):
- What the repository contains, 
- Technologies used, 
- How to run any code, 
- Any other appropriate documentation.
