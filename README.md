<br/>

* **Pands Project**<br/>
> This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. You must research the data set and write documentation and code (in Python) to investigate it. An online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it previously. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.

* **Programming-for-DA**<br/>
> For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish â€“ you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. <br/>

For this project, I chose to create a data set profiling the 'typical' Irish expat from the last two years. Defining an expat for the purpose of the dataset as an Irish person who last left Ireland in the last two years to move abroad for an undefined length of time. I have chosen this topic as it is something I have experience in, I myself moved to Australia in 2015 and lived there for 5 years, before returning to Ireland. It seems that everyone in Ireland has a relation or a friend of a friend that has moved abroad lately, and the purpose of this study is to try and define, or create a profile of the usual Irish expat, and see if there are any connections between the four variables I have chosen.

* **PFDA Project**<br/>
>This project will investigate the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The following list presents the requirements of the project:
 >* Undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background.
 >* Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and compare their performance
 >* Present a statistical analysis of the dataset
 >* Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using SKLearn etc.) and present classification performance results. Detail     your rationale for the parameter selections you made while training the classifiers.
 >* Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature
 >* Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended â€“ using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints
 >*Document your work in a Jupyter notebook.
